# Neural Network Intrusion Detection System

This project is an attempt to create a neural network intrusion detection system against FTP password guessing attacks, DOS attacks, and DDOS attacks.
Currently, a simple nueral network using the [K-Means clustering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) has been designed to detect FTP password guessing attacks.
The network correctly identifies around 80% of normal connections and 95% of attacks for the test cases.

## TODO

 - Find/design a parser for tcp dump data.
 
 - Experiment with self-organizing maps and heiarcical clustering algorithms.
 
 - Experiment with recurrant neural networks.
 
 - Experiment with using data from routers. 
 
 - Similate DOS/DDOS attacks.
 
 - Create nueral network that detects DOS attacks.
 
 - Create nueral network taht detects DDOS attacks.
