# Neural Network Intrusion Detection System

This project is an attempt to create a neural network intrusion detection system against FTP password guessing attacks, DOS attacks, and DDOS attacks.
Currently, a simple nueral network using the [K-Means clustering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) has been designed to detect FTP password guessing attacks.
The network correctly identifies around 80% of normal connections and 95% of attacks for the test cases.

## Organization

 All TODOs for the project are listed under [issues](https://github.com/cwhitman/neural-network-intrusion-detection/issues). Any intermediate research that is made will be posted under the relevant issue.
